            "abstract": "The use of item parcels has been a matter of debate since the earliest use of factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Here, we review the arguments that have been levied both for and against the use of parcels, and discuss the relevance of these arguments in light of the building body of empirical evidence investigating their performance. We discuss the many advantages of parcels that some researchers find attractive and highlight, too, the potential problems that illinformed use can incur. We argue that no absolute pro or con stance is warranted. Parcels are an analytic tool like any other. There are circumstances in which parceling is useful and times when parcels would not be used. We emphasize the precautions that should be taken when creating item parcels and interpreting model results based on parcels. Finally, we review and compare several proposed strategies for parcel building, and suggest directions for further research.",

After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one’s philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Results of an initial preliminary analysis, an analysis using real-world data, and a series of simulation studies were used in the present investigation. Results indicated that available case analysis, mean substitution, and multiple imputation had similar results across low levels of missing data, though in data with higher levels of missing data and other problems (e.g., small sample size or scales with weak internal reliability) mean substitution produced inflation of correlation coefficients among items. The present results support the use of available case analysis when dealing with low-level item-level missingness.",

The author reviews SEM applications based on actual data taken from her research. Noted for its non-mathematical language, this book is written for the novice SEM user. With each chapter, the author ’walks’ the reader through all steps involved in testing the SEM model. The book opens with an introduction to the fundamental concepts of SEM and the basics of the AMOS program. The next 3 sections present applications that focus on single-group, multiple-group, and multitrait-multimethod and latent growth curve models. The book concludes with a discussion about non-normal and missing (incomplete) data and two applications capable of addressing these issues. Intended for researchers, practitioners, and students who use SEM and AMOS in their work, this book is an ideal resource for graduate level courses on SEM taught in departments of psychology, education, business, and other social and health sciences and/or as a supplement in courses on applied statistics, multivariate statistics, statistics II, intermediate or advanced statistics, and/or research design. Appropriate for those with limited or no previous exposure to SEM, a prerequisite of basic statistics through regression analysis is recommended.

Nevertheless, it is common for researchers to underestimate both the benefits of the technique and its potential for misuse. In this article, we consider the two major ways in which psychologists have used the technique: for increasing the precision of estimation in randomized experiments and for seeking to remove bias in nonrandomized studies. In each case, the ANCOVA is compared with analytic alternatives. The argument emphasizes the benefits of using the technique in randomized experiments and warns of the dangers of using it in nonrandomized studies.

            "abstract": "We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.",

            "abstract": "A quiet methodological revolution, a modeling revolution, has occurred over the past several decades, almost without discussion. In contrast, the 20th century ended with contentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate principles involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemology. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychology graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statistical practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemological basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models.

            "abstract": "The presence of outliers, which are data points that deviate markedly from others, is one of the most enduring and pervasive methodological challenges in organizational science research. We provide evidence that different ways of defining, identifying, and handling outliers alter substantive research conclusions. Then, we report results of a literature review of 46 methodological sources (i.e., journal articles, book chapters, and books) addressing the topic of outliers, as well as 232 organizational science journal articles mentioning issues about outliers. Our literature review uncovered (a) 14 unique and mutually exclusive outlier definitions, 39 outlier identification techniques, and 20 different ways of handling outliers; (b) inconsistencies in how outliers are defined, identified, and handled in various methodological sources; and (c) confusion and lack of transparency in how outliers are addressed by substantive researchers. We offer guidelines, including decision-making trees, that researchers can follow to define, identify, and handle error, interesting, and influential (i.e., model fit and prediction) outliers. Although our emphasis is on regression, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling, our general framework forms the basis for a research agenda regarding outliers in the context of other data-analytic approaches. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the consistency and transparency of practices regarding the treatment of outliers in organizational science research.",

In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.",

            "abstract": "Psychologists often have a standoffish attitude toward outliers. Developmental psychologists, in particular, seem uncomfortable with removing cases because of the challenges inherent in obtaining data in the first place. However, the process of identifying and (sometimes) removing outliers is not a witch hunt to cleanse datasets of “weird” cases; rather, dealing with outliers is an important step toward solid, reproducible science. As I’ll demonstrate in this simulated example, a few outliers can completely reverse the conclusions derived from statistical analyses. library(psych) library(tidyverse) library(simstudy) library(jtools) A Hypothetical Case I’ll pretend that I have data on participants’ self-reported affinity for aloneness (i.e., how much time they like being alone), time alone (i.e., number of hours typically spent alone per week), and loneliness. We might expect that people who spend more time alone feel more loneliness. However, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys being alone, maybe being by yourself isn’t so bad. In other words, I’m interested in the moderating effect of time alone on the association between affinity for aloneness and loneliness. Generating the Data I’ll simulate 600 cases using the simstudy package. Because I want the variables correlated, I’ll specify a correlation matrix that makes theoretical sense. c",

            "abstract": "The last 20 years has seen an uptick in research on missing data problems, and most software applications now implement one or more sophisticated missing data handling routines (e.g., multiple imputation or maximum likelihood estimation). Despite their superior statistical properties (e.g., less stringent assumptions, greater accuracy and power), the adoption of these modern analytic approaches is not uniform in psychology and related disciplines. Thus, the primary goal of this manuscript is to describe and illustrate the application of multiple imputation. Although maximum likelihood estimation is perhaps the easiest method to use in practice, psychological data sets often feature complexities that are currently difficult to handle appropriately in the likelihood framework (e.g., mixtures of categorical and continuous variables), but relatively simple to treat with imputation. The paper describes a number of practical issues that clinical researchers are likely to encounter when applying multiple imputation, including mixtures of categorical and continuous variables, item-level missing data in questionnaires, significance testing, interaction effects, and multilevel missing data. Analysis examples illustrate imputation with software packages that are freely available on the internet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, indirect, and conditional effects; probe and visualize interactions; test questions about moderated mediation; and report different types of analyses. Data for all the examples are available on the companion website (www.afhayes.com), along with links to download PROCESS.   New to This Edition *Chapters on using each type of analysis with multicategorical antecedent variables. *Example analyses using PROCESS v3, with annotated outputs throughout the book. *More tips and advice, including new or revised discussions of formally testing moderation of a mechanism using the index of moderated mediation; effect size in mediation analysis; comparing conditional effects in models with more than one moderat∨ using R code for visualizing interactions; distinguishing between testing interaction and probing it; and more. *Rewritten Appendix A, which provides the only documentation of PROCESS v3, including 13 new preprogrammed models that combine moderation with serial mediation or parallel and serial mediation. *Appendix B, describing how to create customized models in PROCESS v3 or edit preprogrammed models.",

Extending to latent variable interactions, we investigated full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation to handle incompletely observed indicators for product indicator (PI) and latent moderated structural equations (LMS)methods. Drawing on the analytic work onmissing data handling techniques in multiple regression with interaction effects, we compared the performance of FIML for PI and LMS analytically. We performed a simulation study to compare FIML for PI and LMS. We recommend using FIML for LMS when the indicators are missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) and when they are normally distributed. FIML for LMS produces unbiased parameter estimates with small variances, correct Type I error rates, and high statistical power of interaction effects. We illustrated the use of these methods by analyzing the interaction effect between advanced cancer patients’ depression and change of inner peace well-being on future hopelessness levels.

            "abstract": "This research examined whether framing a natural disaster as the product of climate change impacts attitudes toward disaster victims and humanitarian relief. Participants (n ¼ 211) read an article about a famine caused by severe droughts, with one condition attributing the droughts to climate change and the other condition made no mention of climate change. All participants then responded to measures of justifications for or against providing aid, attitudes toward the possibility of donating, and climate change beliefs. As predicted, those high in climate change skepticism reported greater justifications for not helping the victims when the disaster was attributed to climate change. Additional moderated mediation analyses showed there was an indirect effect of climate change framing on attitudes toward donating through donation justifications.",

            "abstract": "According to the influence of presumed media influence hypothesis, people estimate the potential effects of media on other people and change their attitudes or behaviors as a consequence. In recent years, many studies offered some support for this idea. However, a central limitation of these studies is that all of them utilized correlational methodology and thus do not offer a valid way to infer causality. The current research examined the causal direction in the influence of presumed media influence using experimental methodology. In Study 1, the authors manipulated the perceived influence of watching pornography and measured the effects of this manipulation on support for censorship. In Study 2, perceptions regarding the influence of a news story about an expected shortage in sugar were manipulated indirectly, by manipulating the perceived exposure to the news story, and behavioral intentions resulting from the story were consequently measured. In both studies, results supported the causal direction postulated by the “presumed influence” hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "We explored whether contact with business-related social ties would buffer entrepreneurs against the potentially deleterious effects of economic stress. Our proposed stress-buffering model builds on the premise that social ties with similar others can serve as both a source of valuable information and a source of empathic support. Findings from a sample of 262 entrepreneurs revealed that the relation between economic stress and intentions to withdraw from entrepreneurial opportunities was stronger among individuals reporting less contact with social ties and weaker among those who reported more contact with social ties. We further examined the indirect effects of economic stress and contact with business-related social ties on entrepreneurs’ future intentions through depressed affect. Results showed that among those reporting less contact with social ties, the indirect effect is positive, meaning greater economic stress leads to higher depressed affect, which in turn results in greater intentions to withdraw from entrepreneurship. Among those with more contact with social ties, there is no evidence of this process at work. We interpret this to mean that social ties serve to buffer the impact of economic stress on depressed affect, which in turn reduces an entrepreneur’s intention to withdraw from entrepreneurship. Those who seem most susceptible to the impact of economic stress are those with relatively limited contact with business-related social ties. We discuss implications and directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "The present study examines the association between dysfunctional team behavior and team performance. Data included measures of teams’ dysfunctional behavior and negative affective tone as well as supervisors’ ratings of teams’ (nonverbal) negative emotional expressivity and performance. Utilizing a field sample of 61 work teams, the authors tested the proposed relationships with robust data analytic techniques. Results were consistent with the hypothesized conceptual scheme, in that negative team affective tone mediated the relationship between dysfunctional team behavior and performance when teams’ nonverbal negative expressivity was high but not when nonverbal expressivity was low. On the basis of the findings, the authors conclude that the connection between dysfunctional behavior and performance in team situations is more complex than was previously believed–thereby yielding a pattern of moderated mediation. In sum, the findings demonstrated that team members’ collective emotions and emotional processing represent key mechanisms in determining how dysfunctional team behavior is associated with team performance.

            "abstract": "(from the chapter) Imagine that you are conducting a large online quantitative survey of countertransference management strategies used by therapists in training. In addition to the quantitative measures included in the survey, you decide to add a single open-ended question asking participants to describe components of their unique clinical experiences that were not captured by the measures in the survey (e.g., \"How do specific client characteristics or presenting issues relate to your unresolved issues?\"). The written responses obtained from your 300 participants contain three or four sentences each and are relatively straightforward and easy to understand. Constructing core ideas as you would for a traditional consensual qualitative research (CQR) analysis seems excessive because the comments are already succinct and there is no context to consider. A briefer alternative to CQR that would produce domains and categories consensually derived from the data would be useful, but you are unsure of how to structure the coding teams, code the data, report the results, or discuss the qualitative findings within the context of the overall study. Fortunately, consensual qualitative research—modified (CQR-M) allows you to do just this task. This chapter provides a brief definition and background of CQR-M followed by a rationale for using CQR-M. We then provide a step-by-step guide to conducting CQR-M analyses. We begin with design considerations, including determining the purpose of the qualitative data and the issue of sample size. Next are steps for data collection, followed by steps for recruiting and training judges. We then describe the procedures for analyzing brief qualitative data, including development of domains and categories, and the consensual coding process. Finally, we provide some guidance for writing up CQR-M results and discussion sections.",

            "abstract": "Growing research supports the link between individual expressions of hope and psychological well‐being. In this paper, we draw on psychological theories of hope, racial and ethnic studies, and the literature on radical healing to propose a framework of radical hope. Although the proposed multidimensional framework integrates cultural practices of People of Color in the United States, it is flexible enough to be adapted to other contexts. The paper begins by providing a brief review of the literature that conceptualizes the concept of hope in the field of psychology as a prelude to comparing the concept to the interdisciplinary notion of radical hope. Based on this body of work, we then introduce a culturally relevant psychological framework of radical hope, which includes the components of collective memory as well as faith and agency. Both components require an orientation to one of four directions including individual orientation, collective orientation, past orientation, and future orientation. The framework also consists of pathways individuals can follow to experience radical hope including (a) understanding the history of oppression along with the actions of resistance taken to transform these conditions, (b) embracing ancestral pride, (c) envisioning equitable possibilities, and (d) creating meaning and purpose in life by adopting an orientation to social justice. We conclude with a proposed research agenda for radical hope. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

In recent years, a theoretical taxonomy and subsequent qualitative studies have introduced the types of microaggressions that people of color experience. In the present study, college- and Internet-based samples of African Americans, Latina/os, Asian Americans, and multiracial participants (N = 661) were used to develop and validate the Racial and Ethnic Microaggression Scale (REMS). In Study 1, an exploratory principal-components analyses (n = 443) yielded a 6-factor model: (a) Assumptions of Inferiority, (b) Second-Class Citizen and Assumptions of Criminality, (c) Microinvalidations, (d) Exoticization/Assumptions of Similarity, (e) Environmental Microaggressions, and (f) Workplace and School Microaggressions, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .912 for the overall model and subscales ranging from .783 to .873. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis (n = 218) supported the 6-factor model with a Cronbach’s alpha of .892. Further analyses indicate that the REMS is a valid measure of racial microaggressions, as evidenced by high correlations with existing measures of racism and participants’ feedback. Future research directions and implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Scholars in diverse disciplines have examined the associations between psychological adjustment and microaggression, and overt discrimination. It remains unclear whether the roles of microaggression in adjustment outcomes can be differentiated from the roles of overt discrimination and neuroticism. I examined the extent to which racial microaggression explained unique variances of negative affect, alcohol consumption, and drinking problems while controlling for overt discrimination and neuroticism among African American, Asian American, and Latinx American college students (N = 713). Intervening roles of psychological distress linking microaggression and overt discrimination to adjustment outcomes were also tested. Among African Americans, microaggression and overt discrimination did not consistently predict psychological adjustment. Among Asian and Latinx Americans, microaggression and overt discrimination predicted negative affect via psychological distress. Microaggression also explained the variances of alcohol use outcomes among Asian Americans. Findings are discussed in the context of an acute racism reactions model and underscore the importance of considering overt discrimination and microaggression simultaneously as determinants of psychological adjustment.",

            "abstract": "This study examined a specific type of racial microaggression known as an exceptionalizing stereotype, in which an action is framed as interpersonally complimentary but perpetuates negative stereotypical views of a racial/ethnic group. Asian American participants (N = 68) were assigned to 1 of 3 brief semistructured interview conditions that highlight an exceptionalizing stereotype of Asian Americans to varying degrees. In the low racially loaded condition, participants were told, ’You speak English well’ by a White confederate. In the high racially loaded condition, they were told, ’You speak English well for an Asian.’ In the control condition, the confederate said, ’Nice talking to you.’ Only participants in the high racially loaded condition rated their partner, the interaction, and future interactions less favorably than participants in the control condition. They also evaluated their partner and interaction less positively than participants in the low racial loading condition. The results suggest exceptionalizing stereotypes can be interpersonally damaging for Asian Americans. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 73(7) of American Psychologist (see record [rid]2018-48461-011[/rid]). In the article, there was a citation error. In the ’Clinical Trials’ subsection in the section, ’Reporting Standards for Studies With an Experimental Manipulation’ (p. 13), the reference to the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki should be to the 2008 version of the declaration. The sentence should read as follows: From an ethical perspective, the Declaration of Helsinki, which is the set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation developed by the World Medical Association, Inc. (2008), stated that ’every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject’ (Item 19, p. 3). The corrected reference, on p. 25, is also presented in the erratum.] Following a review of extant reporting standards for scientific publication, and reviewing 10 years of experience since publication of the first set of reporting standards by the American Psychological Association (APA; APA Publications and Communications Board Working Group on Journal Article Reporting Standards, 2008), the APA Working Group on Quantitative Research Reporting Standards recommended some modifications to the original standards. Examples of modifications include division of hypotheses, analyses, and conclusions into 3 groupings (primary, secondary, and exploratory) and some changes to the section on meta-analysis. Several new modules are included that report standards for observational studies, clinical trials, longitudinal studies, replication studies, and N-of-1 studies. In addition, standards for analytic methods with unique characteristics and output (structural equation modeling and Bayesian analysis) are included. These proposals were accepted by the Publications and Communications Board of APA and supersede the standards included in the 6th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010).

The JARS Group reviewed efforts in related fields to develop standards and sought input from other knowledgeable groups. The resulting recommendations contain (a) standards for all journal articles, (b) more specific standards for reports of studies with experimental manipulations or evaluations of interventions using research designs involving random or nonrandom assignment, and (c) standards for articles reporting meta-analyses. The JARS Group anticipated that standards for reporting other research designs (e.g., observational studies, longitudinal studies) would emerge over time. This report also (a) examines societal developments that have encouraged researchers to provide more details when reporting their studies, (b) notes important differences between requirements, standards, and recommendations for reporting, and (c) examines benefits and obstacles to the development and implementation of reporting standards.

Taking up this exchange as our point of departure, we work in dialectical and multidimensional ways between the essentialized politics of place on race and critical anti-essentializing foundations in recent Critical Race Feminism and Critical White Studies’ literatures. Working the dialectics and multidimensionality of the place that race makes in academic discourse, we recognize and ethically work through the essentialized politics of place in advancing anti-essentializing understandings of race. In articulating these anti-essentializing understandings, our conceptual essay drives at the notion of a generative politics of place on race in academic discourse. A generative politics of place holds essentialized realities and anti-essentializing foundations of race in dialectical and multidimensional tension for teaching, learning, and discussing race in local, national, and international contexts.",

            "abstract": "Expanding on ideas originally proposed by Fassinger and O’Brien (2000), we describe the scientist-practitioner-advocate model for doctoral training in professional psychology, designed to more effectively meet the needs of clients whose presenting problems are rooted in a sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities. This alternative training model incorporates social justice advocacy, thereby equipping graduates to address social contexts implicated in clients’ suffering instead of only the symptoms manifest in a treatment hour. The tripartite model capitalizes on synergies between the new advocate role and the traditional researcher role (e.g., social action research designed to promote change), and between the advocate role and practitioner role (e.g., consciousness raising, public persuasion, and empowerment). At the intersection of all 3 domains is a new type of practicum in social justice advocacy, supported by training in intergroup dialogue facilitation. We describe proposed knowledge, skills, and attitude components of the advocate role, together with a 10-credit curriculum adopted by the University of Tennessee, Counseling Psychology Program. In 2009, this program was the first to be accredited by the American Psychological Association with a scientist-practitioner-advocate training model. Practical challenges in implementation are described. Finally, we discuss implications for course development, student selection, and evaluation of training outcomes.

            "abstract": "An ’open science movement’ is gaining traction across many disciplines within the research enterprise but is also precipitating consternation among those who worry that too much disruption may be hampering professional productivity. Despite this disruption, proponents of open data collaboration have argued that some of the biggest problems of the 21st century need to be solved with the help of many people and that data sharing will be the necessary engine to make that happen. In the United States, a national strategic plan for data sharing encouraged the federally funded scientific agencies to (a) publish open data for community use in discoverable, machine-readable, and useful ways; (b) work with public and civil society organizations to set priorities for data to be shared; (c) support innovation and feedback on open data solutions; and (d) continue efforts to release and enhance high-priority data sets funded by taxpayer dollars. One of the more visible open data projects in the psychological sciences is the presidentially announced ’Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies’ (BRAIN) initiative. Lessons learned from initiatives such as these are instructive both from the perspective of open science within psychology and from the perspective of understanding the psychology of open science. Recommendations for creating better pathways to ’walk the walk’ in open science include (a) nurturing innovation and agile learning, (b) thinking outside the paradigm, (c) creating simplicity from complexity, and (d) participating in continuous learning evidence platforms.

            "abstract": "Routine data sharing, defined here as the publication of the primary data and any supporting materials required to interpret the data acquired as part of a research study, is still in its infancy in psychology, as in many domains. Nevertheless, with increased scrutiny on reproducibility and more funder mandates requiring sharing of data, the issues surrounding data sharing are moving beyond whether data sharing is a benefit or a bane to science, to what data should be shared and how. Here, we present an overview of these issues, specifically focusing on the sharing of so-called ’long tail’ data, that is, data generated by individual laboratories as part of largely hypothesis-driven research. We draw on experiences in other domains to discuss attitudes toward data sharing, cost-benefits, best practices and infrastructure. We argue that the publishing of data sets is an integral component of 21st-century scholarship. Moreover, although not all issues around how and what to share have been resolved, a consensus on principles and best practices for effective data sharing and the infrastructure for sharing many types of data are largely in place.

This article discusses how research data in psychology can be made accessible for reproducibility and reanalysis by describing practical ways to overcome barriers to data sharing. We examine key issues surrounding the sharing of data such as who owns research data, how to protect the confidentiality of the research participant, how to give appropriate credit to the data creator, how to deal with metadata and codebooks, how to address provenance, and other specifics such as versioning and file formats. The protection of research subjects is a fundamental obligation, and we explain frameworks and procedures designed to protect against the harms that may result from disclosure of confidential information. We also advocate greater recognition for data creators and the authors of program code used in the management and analysis of data. We argue that research data and program code are important scientific contributions that should be cited in the same way as publications.

            "abstract": "The potential for big data to provide value for psychology is significant. However, the pursuit of big data remains an uncertain and risky undertaking for the average psychological researcher. In this article, we address some of this uncertainty by discussing the potential impact of big data on the type of data available for psychological research, addressing the benefits and most significant challenges that emerge from these data, and organizing a variety of research opportunities for psychology. Our article yields two central insights. First, we highlight that big data research efforts are more readily accessible than many researchers realize, particularly with the emergence of open-source research tools, digital platforms, and instrumentation. Second, we argue that opportunities for big data research are diverse and differ both in their fit for varying research goals, as well as in the challenges they bring about. Ultimately, our outlook for researchers in psychology using and benefiting from big data is cautiously optimistic. Although not all big data efforts are suited for all researchers or all areas within psychology, big data research prospects are diverse, expanding, and promising for psychology and related disciplines.

We do not view any particular research method as inherently contributing to ’epistemological violence’ (Yakushko et al., 2016, p. 5), but it is the misguided application and/or interpretation of data generated from such methods that perpetuate oppression.

For internal validity or valid causal inference, designs and methods to draw causal conclusions from nonrandomized studies are considered. Greater collaboration between the causal inference and structural equation modeling traditions would benefit both. For external validity, generalizing results, treating partners and studies as well as participants as random is strongly encouraged. For construct validity, particularly the psychological meaning of measures, multivariate models that treat measures from both overtime and dyadic data as being a combination of multiple constructs are discussed. For conclusion validity or valid statistical inference, the problem of low power when generalizability is high and the assumption of independence are discussed. Finding the truth in psychological research is a challenge, and seemingly insurmountable difficulties are often encountered.

            "abstract": "Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

            "abstract": "Faculty of color experience a number of challenges within academia, including tokenism, marginalization, racial microaggressions, and a disconnect between their racial/ethnic culture and the culture within academia. The present study examined epistemic exclusion as another challenge in which formal institutional systems of evaluation combine with individual biases toward faculty of color to devalue their scholarship and deem them illegitimate as scholars. Using data from interviews with 118 faculty of color from a single predominantly White, research-intensive institution, we found that epistemic exclusion occurs through formal hierarchies that determine how scholarship is valued and the metrics used to assess quality, and through informal processes that further convey to faculty of color that they and their scholarship are devalued. In addition, there was variability in reporting these experiences by race, gender, nationality, and discipline. We found that faculty of color coped with epistemic exclusion by being assertive and by seeking validation and support outside the institution. Finally, participants described a number of negative work-related and psychological consequences of their epistemic exclusion. We discuss epistemic exclusion as a form of academic gatekeeping that impedes the recruitment, advancement, and retention of faculty of color and offer strategies to address this barrier.

This article aims to contribute to the decolonisation of research in a sub-Saharan African context by exploring Ubuntu as an indigenous Southern African research paradigm. Drawing on lessons learnt from participatory action research with South African science teachers and on Ubuntu research literature, I develop, and reflect on, characteristics of an Ubuntu research ethics, agenda and methodology. Understood as humanness, Ubuntu encompasses a dimension of becoming human and being human. Both dimensions are realised through lived community and respectful, caring relations with other living beings and the environment. Thus, ethical protocols evolve around relating positively to others. Ubuntu research agendas contribute to strengthening community and methodologies are community based, relational and participatory. The emphasis of the article is not on presenting Ubuntu research as categorically oppositional to conventional methodologies, but on an approach to research that is grounded in indigenous African epistemologies.",

            "abstract": "African American communities have experienced negative effects from a history of medical abuse, lack of proper research procedures, and misinterpretations of study findings because of racism. These past injustices have led to a mistrust of research and researchers. This paper focuses on how some methodological challenges, in a study funded by a National Institutes of Health grant on two low-income African American communities in Kentucky, were mediated through the collaboration of a multi-racial/ethnic team of researchers engaged in cross-disciplinary research. The information for this paper is based on the reflections of key members of the research team. The reflections show that having researchers with different epistemologies resulted in a culturally aware and sensitive study in which emic and etic research approaches were adopted. The inclusion of race-based epistemologies and close community ties were found to be particularly useful in building trust and getting the support of the two communities. However, these outcomes were only possible because research team members provided each other latitude for intellectual freedom and leadership.

Decolonising methodologies have potential, but it is important to be aware of possible limitations. I argue that the manner in which decolonising methodologies is located in the paradigm debate is limiting and prescriptive, lacks clarity of the concepts that it draws on, reproduces problematic representations of the marginalised, overemphasises how much choice researchers have in choosing decolonising methodologies, and does not address the systemic barriers to decolonisation scholarship. Recommendations for how to strengthen decolonising methodologies are presented.",

            "abstract": "Few past studies have used conjoint analysis to assess message design features and even fewer have looked at health issues. This research applies conjoint analysis to the quest to design motivational messages for African Americans at risk for diet-related adverse health outcomes (e.g., heart disease) in Kentucky. African American health in the state of Kentucky can benefit from a diet high in fruit and vegetable consumption, but little past research has been conducted with African American Kentuckians to explore the best message structure for communicating about increased fruit and vegetable consumption. This study reports on the outcome of the final phase of formative campaign research. We use an adaptive conjoint analysis to identify the most important elements of message design for this group of Kentucky residents. Results indicate that the message’s source (i.e., the person delivering the message) is the most important design element for creating persuasive health messaging about fruit and vegetables for African Americans in Kentucky, followed by the stated benefit of eating more fruit and vegetables and the manner in which the behavior is described, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first to treat campaign message features as the subject of a conjoint analysis in order to identify which combination of features might be most motivating for a specific target audience. Recommendations for future health communication campaign application, as well as future research are discussed.",

In this Tutorial, to facilitate reproducible psychological research, we present a tool that creates reproducible tables that follow the American Psychological Association’s (APA’s) style. Our tool, apaTables, automates the creation of APA-style tables for commonly used statistics and analyses in psychological research: correlations, multiple regressions (with and without blocks), standardized mean differences, N-way independent-groups analyses of variance (ANOVAs), within-subjects ANOVAs, and mixed-design ANOVAs. All tables are saved as Microsoft Word documents, so they can be readily incorporated into manuscripts without manual formatting or transcription of values.",

In the current article, we queried more than 26,000 empirical articles published between 1974 and 2018 in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals to document how often psychological research acknowledges this reality and to examine whether people who edit, write, and participate in the research are systematically connected. We note several findings. First, across the past five decades, psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and although they have increased in developmental and social psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White editors, under which there have been significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications that highlight race have been written by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists within psychological research and that systemic changes are needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end, and in the spirit of the field’s recent emphasis on metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and authors.",

Rather than making predictions about the real world from the laboratory, it is possible to test predictions that specify what ought to happen in the lab. Even ’artificial’ findings may be regarded as interesting because they show what can occur, even if it rarely does; or, where generalizations are made, they may have added force because of artificiality of sample or setting. A misplaced preoccupation with external validity can lead to dismissing good research for which generalization to real life is not intended or meaningful.

            "abstract": "Social experiments tend to have less physical isolation of materials, less procedural standardization, and longer-lasting treatments when compared with laboratory experiments. Social experiments usually test an intervention or treatment that is better described as a global package of components rather than as a unidimensional causal construct. The authors review 4 experimentation topics: (1) modification to the dominant theory of social experimentation, (2) shifts in thinking about the desirability and feasibility of conducting randomized field experiments, (3) modifications to thinking about quasi-experiments (QEs), and (4) concerns about justifying generalized causal inferences. The randomized experiment has gained favor over the QE, although regression-discontinuity and interrupted time series designs promote point-specific causal inferences from QEs. Work on generalizing inferences focuses on meta-analyses and micro-causal-explanatory analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Discussion is guided by the ’bubble hypothesis,’ a view of research recognizing the costs inherent in each solution offered for methodological problems. Part 2 examines issues surrounding the scientific productivity of counseling psychologists and their specialty. Assets and negative features of the scientist-practitioner model are examined, and 2 propositions are offered about the research/science training situation in counseling psychology: First, students enter training with deeply ambivalent attitudes as to the value and meaning of science in their careers and their ability to be effective as scholars. Second, training programs show little that is deliberate and systematic in attempting to foster positive motivation and attitudes. 10 ingredients of effective research training are discussed.

            "abstract": "Play with Barbie dolls is an understudied source of gendered socialization that may convey a sexualized adult world to young girls. Early exposure to sexualized images may have unintended consequences in the form of perceived limitations on future selves. We investigated perceptions of careers girls felt they could do in the future as compared to the number of careers they felt boys could do as a function of condition (playing with a Barbie or Mrs. Potato Head doll) and type of career (male dominated or female dominated) in a sample of 37 U.S. girls aged 4–7 years old residing in the Pacific Northwest. After a randomly assigned 5-min exposure to condition, children were asked how many of ten different occupations they themselves could do in the future and how many of those occupations a boy could do. Data were analyzed with a 2 ×2 × 2 mixed factorial ANOVA. Averaged across condition, girls reported that boys could do significantly more occupations than they could themselves, especially when considering male-dominated careers. In addition, girls’ ideas about careers for themselves compared to careers for boys interacted with condition, such that girls who played with Barbie indicated that they had fewer future career options than boys, whereas girls who played with Mrs. Potato Head reported a smaller difference between future possible careers for themselves as compared to boys. Results support predictions from gender socialization and objectification theories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",

The present study examined whether participation in a six-day spiritual retreat results in changes in perceived stress and whether changes in perceived stress depend on participant’s demographic characteristics. A total of 88 Nigerian Catholic immigrant sisters completed the Perceived Stress questionnaire pre-retreat, day three, and immediately after a spiritual retreat. Friedman Two-way ANOVA by rank was used to determine if there are mean changes in perceived stress over the three-time period, while Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA was used to determine if there were demographic differences in perceived stress. There were no differences in perceived stress at baseline, but there was a significant reduction in perceived stress at Time 2 and 3. There were no differences in perceived stress for the demographic variables except age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Aim The aim of this study was to find out if student nurses feel comfortable in caring by providing support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Questioning adolescents and what factors influence their level of comfort. Background Research indicates that nurses and nursing students experience varying levels of comfort when caring for adults who are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Questioning: adult patients feel that nurse’s attitudes change towards them once they disclose their sexuality. There has been minimal research to date on nursing attitudes to working with adolescents who are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Questioning. Design Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this descriptive study. Questionnaires were completed by 152 nursing students and nine took part in semi-structured focus groups. Method A two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the questionnaires. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes arising from the focus groups. Data were collected between August 2013 - July 2014. Results/Findings The results and findings of the study were that student nurse’s felt discomfort in providing support; due to a lack of knowledge of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual sexuality, personal and religious beliefs and the perceptions of others. However, all students indicated they had a positive attitude towards Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Questioning adolescents. Conclusion More needs to be done to raise self-awareness and improve the level of knowledge in relation to Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual issues amongst student nurses. Educational institutions and practice areas need to recognize this fact and reflect this in their educational programmes.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: In the US people of color are disproportionately affected by pedestrian crashes. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential for racial bias in driver yielding behaviors at midblock crosswalks in low and high income neighborhoods located in the sprawling metropolitan area of Las Vegas, NV. Methods: Participants (1 white, 1 black female) crossed at a midblock crosswalk on a multilane road in a low income and a high income neighborhood. Trained observers recorded (1) number of cars that passed in the nearest lane before yielding while the pedestrian waited near the crosswalk at the curb (2) number of cars that passed through the crosswalk with the pedestrian in the same half of the roadway. Results: The ﬁrst car in the nearest lane yielded to the pedestrian while they waited at the curb 51.5% of the time at the high income and 70.7% of the time at the low income crosswalk. Two way ANOVAs found an interaction effect between income and race on yielding behaviors. Simple effects for income revealed that at the high income crosswalk, drivers were less likely to yield to the white pedestrian while she waited at the curb (F(1,122) = 11.18;p = 0.001), and were less likely to yield to the black pedestrian while she was in the same half of the roadway at the high income crosswalk (F(1,124) = 4.40;p = 0.04). Simple effects for race showed signiﬁcantly more cars passed through the crosswalk while the black pedestrian was in the roadway compared to the white pedestrian at the high income crosswalk (F(1,124) = 6.62;p = 0.01). Conclusions: Bias in driver yielding behavior may be one inﬂuencing factor in higher rates of pedestrian crashes for people of color.",

            "abstract": "Psychological and social identity-related factors have been shown to inﬂuence drivers’ behaviors toward pedestrians, but no previous studies have examined the potential for drivers’ racial bias to impact yielding behavior with pedestrians. If drivers’ yielding behavior results in differential behavior toward Black and White pedestrians, this may lead to disparate pedestrian crossing experiences based on race and potentially contribute to disproportionate safety outcomes for minorities. We tested the hypothesis that drivers’ yielding behavior is inﬂuenced by pedestrians’ race in a controlled ﬁeld experiment at an unsignalized midblock marked crosswalk in downtown Portland, Oregon. Six trained male research team participants (3 White, 3 Black) simulated an individual pedestrian crossing, while trained observers cataloged the number of cars that passed and the time until a driver yielded. Results (88 pedestrian trials, 173 driver-subjects) revealed that Black pedestrians were passed by twice as many cars and experienced wait times that were 32% longer than White pedestrians. Results support the hypothesis that minority pedestrians experience discriminatory treatment by drivers at crosswalks.",

            "abstract": "Rigorously evaluated interventions that target protective factors and positive resources rather than ameliorating negative outcomes in child refugees are rare. To address this, we developed and evaluated a short, group-based resilience-building intervention called Strengths for the Journey (SFJ), which was designed for war-affected children. We conducted a quasi-randomized pilot study of the SFJ intervention with 72 7- to 14-yearold forcibly displaced children (Mage = 10.76, 64.8% female) in three refugee camps in Lesvos, Greece. Intervention effectiveness was assessed by measuring pre-post changes in well-being, self-esteem, optimism, and depressive symptoms from before (T1) to immediately after the intervention/wait-list task (T2). Four focus group interviews were conducted with 31 of the participants to discuss their views on the effects of the intervention and the continued use of the skills that were learned. Using repeated-measures ANOVAs, we found improvements in well-being, F (1, 46) = 42.99, ηp2 = .48, self-esteem, F (1, 56) = 29.11, ηp2 = .40, optimism, F (1, 53) = 27.16, ηp2 = .34, and depressive symptoms, F (1, 31) = 62.14, ηp2 = .67, in the intervention group compared with the wait-listed group ( p < .05). Focus group participants highlighted the importance of SFJ in developing a sense of togetherness and building their strengths. Child refugees in low-resource settings may benefit from brief, first-line interventions that target protective factors such as well-being, hope, self-esteem, and belonging.",

            "abstract": "Although contact-based interventions are the cornerstone of prejudice reduction, in high-conflict environments, incendiary contact with outgroups can instead exacerbate negative attitudes. Supplementing contact interventions with social-cognitive/emotional approaches may, instead, help facilitate positive contact. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two prejudice reduction interventions among 148 Palestinian-Israeli and 154 Jewish-Israeli 5th grade students (Mage.years = 10.55, SD = 0.26) in a high conflict area. Schools in Jaffa, Israel were assigned to a social-cognitive/emotional skills-based intervention, a skills- and contact-based intervention (i.e., skills, skills+contact), or the control group—all delivered as part of the curriculum. Prejudice was assessed through participants’ judgments of and justifications about hypothetical scenarios of intergroup exclusion in peer and home contexts at pre-test, post-test, and 6-month follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed various main effects including gender, ethnicity, and context in which the exclusion occurred (peer/home). Significant higher level interactions with group by time demonstrated the positive influence of both treatment groups on prejudice reduction. The skills and skills+contact groups became more rejecting while the control group became more accepting of exclusion across time. Additionally, the skills and skills+contact groups increased in moral and empathic reasoning over time, whereas the control group increased in social conventional and stereotyped prejudiced reasoning. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of in-school social-cognitive/emotional skills and combined skills+contact approaches in reducing the prejudiced attitudes of Palestinian- and Jewish-Israeli pre-adolescents, especially in areas with protracted conflict.",

We conducted a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of a culturally informed parent education intervention to address this gap.

All participants received baseline and follow-up assessments. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant improvement in child and parent outcomes for the intervention group compared to the control.

Design and Sample A one-group pre- and posttest design was used. A convenience sample of Black adolescent girls between the age of 12–18 (n = 41). Intervention A 60-min 12-week church-based program that included interactive educational sessions followed by a high energy dance aerobics class was used. Measures Data were collected on biophysical measures. Surveys were used to assess the following variables: attitudes, enjoyment, self-efficacy, intention, social and family support, and PA levels. Results Paired t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant changes in key variables. Positive changes were noted in the odds ratios for attitudes, self-efficacy, and intention. Body mass index, metabolic equivalent tasks, and fitness showed positive trends from pre to post intervention. Family support was significantly correlated with physical activity level (p < .01). Conclusions The study showed that physical activity programs in Black churches aimed at Black adolescent girls are feasible. Participants evaluated the intervention very favorably. Family support may be a key factor in increasing physical activity levels in Black adolescent girls.",

            "abstract": "In this longitudinal study, we explored how White students’ (N = 857) color-blind racial ideology (CBRI; i.e., beliefs that serve to deny, minimize, and/or distort the existence of racism) changed over time and the factors associated with these patterns of change. Specifically, we investigated whether gender, diversity attitudes (i.e., openness to diversity and interest in social issues), and college diversity experiences (i.e., diversity-related courses/activities and close interracial friendships) predicted patterns of CBRI change. Findings indicated that gender and diversity attitudes were related to initial levels of CBRI, such that women and students who were more open to diversity issues at the beginning of college were more likely to report lower levels of CBRI; gender was also related to a greater decrease in CBRI changes over the college experience. Furthermore, college diversity experiences predicted changes in CBRI over time, such that students who completed a greater number of diversity courses and activities and those who had a greater number of close Black friends showed a significantly greater decrease in CBRI over their 4 years in college; interestingly, students who reported having no Latino friends compared with having some close Latino friends showed a significantly greater decrease in CBRI over time.

            "abstract": "Multiculturalism, a pluralistic ideology, stresses recognizing and celebrating group differences, whereas color blindness, an assimilationist ideology, stresses ignoring or minimizing group differences. Among dominant-group members, multiculturalism whether experimentally manipulated or measured as an individual difference predicts lower bias, whereas color blindness predicts greater bias. In a field study, we investigated the effects of Whites’ diversity beliefs on their minority co-workers’ psychological engagement, a meaningful target outcome. The 4,915 respondents (48% response rate; 80% female, 20% male; 79% White, 21% minority; modal age 42–60 years) mirrored organizational demographics (79% female, 21% male; 79% White, 21% minority; modal age 42– 60 years). The result indicates that diversity beliefs impact engagement despite dispersion. It is concluded that by making multiple advances across areas of psychology, we have shown that poor diversity climates cost and positive diversity climates benefit both minorities and organizations.

White American college students were exposed to a message advocating either a color-blind or a multicultural ideological approach to reducing interethnic tension and then completed explicit racial attitude measures, as well as a reaction time measure of automatic evaluations of racial groups. Results suggested that, relative to the multicultural perspective, the color-blind perspective generated greater racial attitude bias measured both explicitly and on the more unobtrusive reaction time measure. The findings of the present study add to previous research advocating a multicultural or dual-identity model of intergroup relations as the more promising route to interracial harmony.",

            "abstract": "The automatic or blind inclusion of control variables in multiple regression and other analyses, intended to purify observed relationships among variables of interest, is widespread and can be considered an example of practice based on a methodological urban legend. Inclusion of such variables in most cases implicitly assumes that the control variables are somehow either contaminating the measurement of the variables of interest or affecting the underlying constructs, thus distorting observed relationships among them. There are, however, a number of alternative mechanisms that would produce the same statistical results, thus throwing into question whether inclusion of control variables has led to more or less accurate interpretation of results. The authors propose that researchers should be explicit rather than implicit regarding the role of control variables and match hypotheses precisely to both the choice of variables and the choice of analyses. The authors further propose that researchers avoid testing models in which demographic variables serve as proxies for variables that are of real theoretical interest in their data.",

            "abstract": "Research suggests that, owing to bias and discrimination in policing, members of historically marginalized groups—such as Black/African Americans and sexual minority people—report more negative perceptions of police than individuals from more privileged groups. However, research has yet to explore whether racial minority and sexual minority statuses contribute additively or interactively to perceptions of police. To this end, we compared perceptions of police across racial (Black and White) and sexual orientation (sexual minority and heterosexual) groups. The sample was composed of 86 Black heterosexual individuals, 127 Black sexual minority individuals, 129 White heterosexual individuals, and 58 White sexual minority individuals. Before conducting these comparisons, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses (MG-CFAs) were performed to determine whether the measure of perceptions of police demonstrated evidence of measurement invariance across racial and sexual orientation groups. Results of the MG-CFAs suggested that the Perceptions of Police Scale demonstrated adequate fit and that configural and metric invariance was obtained across racial and sexual orientation groups. However, only partial scalar invariance was obtained across racial groups. Analysis of covariance results indicated that there were significant main effects of racial minority status and sexual minority status that were qualified by a Race × Sexual Orientation interaction. Specifically, White heterosexual participants reported significantly more favorable perceptions of the police than the other three groups, who did not differ significantly from each other. Implications for future research and practice are discussed, such as the need to examine psychological effects of negative perceptions of police within marginalized communities.

            "abstract": "This article presents the Parent Resource for Increasing Sexual Minority Support (PRISMS), an interactive online intervention designed by the authors to promote parental self-efficacy and behavioral intentions for supporting a sexual minority child. The intervention was developed based upon psychological literature about parent support and feedback from parents of sexual minority youth and psychologists, and contains 5 interactive online modules: normalizing parent experiences, psychoeducation, reflection upon existing support, rehearsal of support, and affirmation. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of PRISMS and collected pilot data to assess its efficacy. One hundred eighty-four U.S. parents of sexual minority youth Ages 13 to 18 were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and were randomly assigned to complete either PRISMS (n = 92) or a control: an existing resource with psychoeducation about sexual orientation (n = 92). Analyses revealed that PRISMS was highly acceptable to participants and established the noninferiority of the intervention relative to the control in terms of credibility and affect at posttest. Two analyses of covariance did not establish significant associations between PRISMS and parental self-efficacy or behavioral intentions for supportive parenting, although we found small effect sizes (d = .31 and .21). Post hoc exploratory analyses offered preliminary support for the efficacy of PRISMS with parents who were highly distressed about their child’s sexual orientation, suggesting that this might be an important population for future research. We discuss implications for research and practice, including the importance of interventions for parents of sexual minority youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "The use of control variables plays a central role in organizational research due to practical difficulties associated with the implementation of experimental and quasi‐experimental designs. As such, we conducted an in‐depth review and content analysis of what variables, and why such variables are controlled for, in 10 of the most popular research domains (task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, turnover, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, employee burnout, personality, leader-member exchange, organizational justice, and affect) in organizational behavior/human resource management (OB/HRM) and applied psychology. Specifically, we examined 580 articles published from 2003 to 2012 in AMJ, ASQ, JAP, JOM, and PPsych. Results indicate that, across research domains with clearly distinct theoretical bases, the overwhelming majority of the more than 3,500 controls identified in our review converge around the same simple demographic factors (i.e., gender, age, tenure), very little effort is made to explain why and how controls relate to focal variables of interest, and control variable practices have not changed much over the past decade. To address these results, we offer best‐practice recommendations in the form of a sequence of questions and subsequent steps that can be followed to make decisions on the appropriateness of including a specific control variable within a particular theoretical framework, research domain, and empirical study. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the transparency and appropriateness of practices regarding control variable usage.

            "abstract": "Comparison of groups is a common statistical test in many biomedical and psychosocial research studies. When there are more than two groups, one first performs an omnibus test for an overall difference across the groups. If this null is rejected, one then proceeds to the next step of post-hoc pairwise group comparisons to determine sources of difference. Otherwise, one stops and declares no group difference. A common belief is that if the omnibus test is significant, there must exist at least two groups that are significantly different and vice versa. Thus, when the omnibus test is significant, but no post-hoc between-group comparison shows significant difference, one is bewildered at what is going on and wondering how to interpret the results. At the end of the spectrum, when the omnibus test is not significant, one wonders if all post-hoc tests will be non-significant as well so that stopping after a nonsignificant omnibus test will not lead to any missed opportunity of finding group difference. In this report, we investigate this perplexing phenomenon and discuss how to interpret such results.",

This 6-item scale includes two subscales: College Response to LGBTQ Students and LGBTQ Stigma. We provide evidence for structural validity (via exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses) and reliability for scores on this new measure. Supporting construct validity, Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate full scale and subscales were each positively correlated with experiences of LGBTQ victimization on campus, anxiety, and depression and negatively correlated with satisfaction with college and intention to persist in college. Relationships with mental health and academic outcomes held true, even after controlling for LGBTQ victimization experiences, providing support for incremental validity. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.",

This paper provides an introduction to when and how to conduct a meta-analysis. Several practical questions, such as advantages of meta-analysis over conventional narrative review and the number of studies required for a meta-analysis, are addressed. Common meta-analytic models are then introduced. An artificial dataset is used to illustrate how a meta-analysis is conducted in several software packages. The paper concludes with some common pitfalls of meta-analysis and their solutions. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a summary background to readers who would like to conduct their first meta-analytic study.",

            "abstract": "Meta-analysis is a systematic approach of synthesizing, combining, and analyzing data from multiple studies (randomized clinical trials or observational studies) into a single effect estimate to answer a research question. Meta-analysis is especially useful if there is debate around the research question in the literature published to date or the individual published studies are underpowered. Vital to a high-quality meta-analysis is a comprehensive literature search, prespecified hypothesis and aims, reporting of study quality, consideration of heterogeneity and examination of bias. In the hierarchy of evidence, meta-analysis appears above observational studies and randomized clinical trials because it rigorously collates evidence across a larger body of literature; however, meta-analysis is largely dependent on the quality of the primary data.",

            "abstract": "This qualitative study examines how Black undergraduate students attending a predominately White institution (PWI) assess and interpret their university’s diversity and inclusion initiatives given their everyday experiences with campus-based racism. Using critical race theory (CRT) this article illuminates how Black students at a PWI interpret their university’s implementation of diversity and inclusion initiatives. The article illustrates how the students interpreted the rationale behind the university’s implementation of the diversity and inclusion initiatives, questioned who benefits from the implementation of the initiatives, and called attention to how the ineffectiveness of the PWIs initiatives impacted their sense of belonging. By employing the concept of interest-convergence as an analytical tool, this article used the students’ narratives to illustrate what happens when initiatives aimed at promoting a more equitable and inclusive campus racial climate converge with the interests of an institution that centers Whiteness. The findings from this study illustrate the ways in which White supremacy undergirds the university’s implementation of its diversity and inclusion initiatives and the reality it creates for Black students.

Results indicate that discussions about courses with fellow students outside class and membership in religious and social-community organizations are strongly associated with students’ sense of belonging. First-year experiences have positive effects on Latino students, whereas perceptions of a hostile racial climate have a direct negative impact on students’ sense of belonging in the third year.",

The author proposes that individuals’ perceptions of their own cohesion to a group include a sense of belonging and feelings of morale. This conceptualization and the adequacy of a newly developed Perceived Cohesion Scale were tested in 2 random samples: 102 students at a small college noted for its strong ’school spirit’ and 110 residents of a mid-sized city. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated a 2-factor model, with a high degree of invariance across the samples and with the 2 dimensions correlated over .90 in both. However, as anticipated, perceived cohesion was significantly higher in the college than the city sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Over the past several decades, scholars and universities have made efforts to increase the retention of students in higher education, but graduation rates remain low. Whereas two-thirds of high school graduates attend college, fewer than half graduate. The likelihood of graduation decreases even more for Black, Latino, American Indian, and low-income students, who have a 12–15% lower chance of earning their degree. The importance of psychosocial adjustment to student persistence has received relatively less attention than academic and social integration. Racial/ethnic minority students face unique challenges to psychosocial adjustment in college, including prejudice and discrimination, unwelcoming campus environments, underrepresentation, and a lack of culturally appropriate counseling resources. The current chapter will discuss the impact of these challenges on the persistence, academic success, and health of racial/ethnic minority students, and strategies that universities can employ to create inclusive policies, resources and campus environments that empower students of color and maximize their success.",

            "abstract": "The negative impacts of racism, including experiences of racial trauma, are well documented (e.g., Bryant-Davis & Ocampo, 2006; Carter, 2007). Because of the deleterious effects of racial trauma on Black people, interventions that facilitate the resistance and prevention of anti-Black racism are needed. Critical consciousness is one such intervention, as it is often seen as a prerequisite of resistance and liberation (Prilleltensky, 2003, 2008). To understand how individuals advance from being aware of anti-Black racism to engaging in actions to prevent and resist racial trauma, nonconfidential interviews with 12 Black Lives Matter activists were conducted. Using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) under critical-ideological and Black feminist-womanist lenses, a model of Critical Consciousness of Anti-Black Racism (CCABR) was co-constructed. The 3 processes involved in developing CCABR include: witnessing anti-Black racism, processing anti-Black racism, and acting critically against anti-Black racism. This model, including each of the categories and subcategories, are detailed herein and supported with quotations. The findings and discussion provide context-rich and practical approaches to help Black people, and counseling psychologists who serve them, prevent and resist racial trauma.

            "abstract": "The psychological literature on AfroLatinidad is sparse. The absence of Blackness in Latinx Psychology is due in part to Mestizaje Racial Ideologies (MRIs), or the belief that all people of Latinx descent are racially mixed and therefore skin-color and phenotypical differences do not matter. This colonial and anti-Blackness ideology has been so deeply rooted in the Latinx ethos that its implications and manifestations are seldomly interrogated. In turn, we default to a praxis that often studies, describes, and conceptualizes Latinidad through racially homogenous and color-blind paradigms. Put succinctly, we produce and reproduce scientific knowledge that fails to capture the unique racialized experiences of Black Latinxs. To this end, the goal of this paper is to provide action guidelines that will help acknowledge and integrate Blackness into the field of Latinx Psychology and disrupt the pervasive raceless narrative of MRIs. To achieve this goal, a brief history of Blackness and anti-Blackness in Latin America are outlined, followed by a discussion on the invisibility of Blackness in Latinx Psychology. Drawing on theory of intersectionality, the Centering Racial and Ethnic Identity for Latinxs (C-REIL) framework, which underscores the role of race, ethnicity, racism and ethnocentrism in the study of Latinxs, is introduced as a prelude to five guidelines that include: (a) anchoring AfroLatinidad in historical knowledge, (b) dismantling anti-Blackness, (c) acknowledging and including the role of Blackness in Latinx Psychology research and practice, (d) valuing Blackness as a political stance, and (e) practicing Latinx Psychology without the White gaze.

            "abstract": "Evaluating sociocultural factors that may influence acculturation strategies rather than assuming homogeneity among different Latinx ethnic groups is important. A latent profile analysis with covariates was used to identify acculturation profiles in a sample of first-generation Central Florida Puerto Ricans (N = 381) along bidimensional behavioral, values, and ethnic identity indicators. We examined whether three contextual covariates including (a) perceived ethnicracial discrimination, (b) percentage of White Americans, and (c) percentage of Puerto Ricans residing in each participants’ zip code could help derive latent profile membership. Participants were categorized into three profiles. The first profile exhibited the highest levels of White American ethnic identity and high levels of Puerto Rican and White American cultural behaviors. The second profile described individuals with the lowest adherence to White American behaviors and ethnic identity. It also exhibited high attachment to Puerto Rican cultural values. The third profile exhibited high levels of Puerto Rican and White American cultural values and moderate levels of White American cultural behaviors and ethnic identity. An examination of covariates revealed that only perceived ethnic-racial discrimination had an influence on profile identification and membership, with likelihood of belonging to Profile 2 decreasing, and likelihood of belonging to Profile 1 increasing as perceived ethnic-racial discrimination increased. Perceived ethnicracial discrimination did not influence the likelihood of Profile 3 membership. Results highlight the importance of contextualizing acculturation.",

            "abstract": "This discussion paper argues that both the use of Cronbach’s alpha as a reliability estimate and as a measure of internal consistency suffer from major problems. First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score’s reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test’s internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals’ test performance. The paper ends with a list of conclusions about the usefulness of alpha.",
