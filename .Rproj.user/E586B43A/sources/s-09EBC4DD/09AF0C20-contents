The focus of this lecture is analysis of covariance. Sticking with the same research vignette, we rearrange the variables a bit to see how they work in an ANCOVA design. The results help clarify the distinction between moderator and covariate.

## Navigating this Lesson

There is about just about an hour of lecture.  If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour or two

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail.  All original materials are provided at the [Github site](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReCenterPsychStats) that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's [introduction](#ReCintro)

### Learning Objectives

Focusing on this week's materials, make sure you can:

* Define a covariate and distinguish it from a moderator.
* Recognize the case where ANCOVA is a defensible statistical approach for analyzing the data.
* Name and test the assumptions underlying ANCOVA.
* Analyze, interpret, and write up results for ANCOVA.
* List the conditions that are prerequisite for the appropriate use of a covariate or control variable.

### Planning for Practice

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty The least complex is to change the random seed and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results *should* map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. 

The second option comes from the research vignette. For this ANCOVA article, I take a lot of liberties with the variables and research design. You could further mix and match for a different ANCOVA constellation. 

As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for ANCOVA. In either case, you will be expected to:

* test the statistical assumptions
* conduct an ANCOVA, including
  - omnibus test and effect size
  - report main effects and engage in any follow-up testing
  - interpret results in light of the role of the second predictor variable as a *covariate* (as opposed to the moderating role in the prior lessons)
* write a results section to include a figure and tables

## Introducing Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) evaluates the null hypothesis that

* population means on a dependent variable are equal across levels of a factor(s) adjusting for differences on a covariate(s); stated differently -
* the population adjusted means are equal across groups

This lecture introduces a distinction between **moderators** and **covariates**.  

**Moderator**: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

**Covariate**:  an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable.  It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Understanding this difference may be facilitated by understanding one of the assumptions of ANCOVA -- that the slopes relating the covariate to the dependent variable are the same for all groups (i.e., the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption).  If this assumption is violated then the between-group differences in adjusted means are not interpretable and the covariate should be treated as a moderator and analyses that assess the simple main effects (i.e., follow-up to a significant interaction) should be conducted.

A one-way ANCOVA requires three variables:

* IV/factor -- categorical (2 or more)
* DV -- continuous
* Covariate -- continuous

Green and Salkind [@green_one-way_2014-1] identified common uses of ANCOVA:

* Studies with a pretest and random assignment of subjects to factor levels. Variations on this research design include: 
  - assignment to factor levels based on that pretest,
  - matching based on the pretest, and random assignment to factor levels,
  - simply using the pretest as a covariate for the posttest DV.
* Studies with a potentially confounding variable (best when there is theoretical justification and prior empirical evidence for such) over which the researcher wants "control"

Although it is possible to have multi-way (e.g., 2-way, 3-way) ANCOVA, in this lecture we will only work two, one-way ANCOVAs representing these larger questions.

ANCOVA has four primary assumptions:

**Linearity**  The covariate is linearly related to the dependent variable within all levels of the factor (IV).

**Homogeneity of regression slopes** The weights or slopes relating the covariate to the DV are equal across all levels of the factor.

**Normally distributed**  The DV is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor.  This assumption applies to every combination of the values of the covariate and levels of the factor and requires them all to be normally distributed.  To the degree that population distributions are not normal and sample sizes are small, *p* values may not be trustworthy and power reduced. Evaluating this is frequently operationalized by inspecting the residuals and identifying outliers.  

**Homogeneity of variances** The variances of the DV for the conditional distributions (i.e., every combination of the values of the covariate and levels of the factor) are equal.

We are following the approach to analyzing ANCOVA identifed in the Datanovia lesson on ANCOVA [@noauthor_ancova_nodate].

Our analytic process will be similar to others in the ANOVA series:

1. Prepare the data
2. Evaluate potential violation of the assumptions
3. Compute the omnibus ANCOVA, and follow-up accordingly
   - Significant?  Follow-up with post-hoc comparisons, planned contrasts, and/or polynomial
   - Stopping if there is no significance
   
An ANCOVA workflow maps this in further detail.

## Research Vignette

We will continue with the example used in the [mixed design ANOVA lesson](#Mixed) The article does not contain any ANCOVA analyses, but there is enough data that I can demonstrate the two general ways (i.e., controlling for the pretest, controlling for a potentially confounding variable) that ANCOVA is used.

Here's a quick reminder of the research vignette.

Murrar and Brauer's [-@murrar_entertainment-education_2018] article described the results of two studies designed to reduce prejudice against Arabs/Muslims. In the lesson on mixed design ANOVA, we only worked the first of two experiments reported in the study. Participants (*N* = 193), all who were White, were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they watched six episodes of the sitcom [*Friends*](http://www.friends-tv.org/) or [*Little Mosque on the Prairie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie). The sitcoms and specific episodes were  selected after significant pilot testing. The selection was based on the tension between being as similar as possible, yet the intervention-oriented sitcom needed to invoke psychologial processes known to reduce prejudice. The authors felt that both series had characters that were likable and relatable and were engaged in activities of daily living. The Friends series featured characters who were predominantly White, cis-gendered, and straight. The Little Mosque series portrays the experience Western Muslims and Arabs as they live in a small Canadian town.  This study involved assessment across three waves:  baseline (before watching the assigned episodes), post1 (immediately after watching the episodes), and post2 (completed 4-6 weeks after watching the episodes).

The study used *feelings and liking thermometers*, rating their feelings and liking toward 10 different groups of people on a 0 to 100 sliding scale (with higher scores reflecting greater liking and positive feelings. For the purpose of this analysis, the ratings of attitudes toward White people and attitudes toward Arabs/Muslims were used.  A third metric was introduced by subtracting the attitudes towards Arabs/Muslims from the attitudes toward Whites. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes toward Whites where as low scores indicated no difference in attitudes. To recap, there were three potential dependent variables, all continuously scaled:

* AttWhite:  attitudes toward White people; higher scores reflect greater liking
* AttArab:  attitudes toward Arab people; higher scores reflect greater liking
* Diff:  the difference between AttWhite and AttArab; higher scores reflect a greater liking for White people

With random assignment, nearly equal cell sizes, a condition with two levels (Friends, Little Mosque), and three waves (baseline, post1, post2), this is perfect for mixed design ANOVA but suitable for an ANCOVA demonstration.

### Simulating the data from the journal article

Below is the code I have used to simulate the data. The simulation includes two dependent variables (AttWhite, AttArab), Wave (baseline, post1, post2), and COND (condition; Friends, Little_Mosque).  There is also a caseID (repeated three times across the three waves) and rowID (giving each observation within each case an ID). You can use this simulation for two of the three practice suggestions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(210813)#change this to any different number (and rerun the simulation) to rework the chapter problem
AttWhite<-round(c(rnorm(98,mean=76.79,sd=18.55),rnorm(95,mean=75.37,sd=18.99),rnorm(98, mean=77.47, sd=18.95), rnorm(95, mean=75.81, sd=19.29), rnorm(98, mean=77.79, sd=17.25), rnorm(95, mean=75.89, sd=19.44)),3) #sample size, M and SD for each cell; this will put it in a long file
AttWhite[AttWhite>100]<-100 #set upper bound for variable
AttWhite[AttWhite<0]<-0 #set lower bound for variable
AttArab<-round(c(rnorm(98,mean=64.11,sd=20.97),rnorm(95,mean=64.37,sd=20.03),rnorm(98, mean=64.16, sd=21.64), rnorm(95, mean=70.52, sd=18.55), rnorm(98, mean=65.29, sd=19.76), rnorm(95, mean=70.30, sd=17.98)),3)
AttArab[AttArab>100]<-100 #set upper bound for variable
AttArab[AttArab<0]<-0 #set lower bound for variable
rowID <- factor(seq(1,579))
caseID <- rep((1:193),3)
Wave <- c(rep("Baseline",193), rep("Post1", 193), rep ("Post2", 193))
COND <- c(rep("Friends", 98), rep("LittleMosque", 95), rep("Friends", 98), rep("LittleMosque", 95), rep("Friends", 98), rep("LittleMosque", 95))
Murrar_df<- data.frame(rowID, caseID, Wave, COND, AttArab, AttWhite) #groups the 3 variables into a single df:  ID#, DV, condition
#make caseID a factor
Murrar_df[,'caseID'] <- as.factor(Murrar_df[,'caseID'])
#make Wave an ordered factor
Murrar_df$Wave <- factor(Murrar_df$Wave, levels = c("Baseline", "Post1", "Post2"))
#make COND an ordered factor
Murrar_df$COND <- factor(Murrar_df$COND, levels = c("Friends", "LittleMosque"))
Murrar_df$Diff <- Murrar_df$AttWhite - Murrar_df$AttArab #creates the difference score
```

Let's check the structure. We want 

* rowID and caseID to be unordered factors,
* Wave and COND to be ordered factors,  
* AttArab, AttWhite, and Diff to be numerical

```{r}
str(Murrar_df)
```

Let's check the structure again.
```{r}
str(Murrar_df)
```

If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv ("Excel lite") or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. This is what I would do.
```{r}
#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with
#saveRDS(Murrar_df, "Murrar_RDS.rds")
#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file
#Murrar_df <- readRDS("Murrar_RDS.rds")
```

The code for .csv will likely lose the formatting (i.e., stripping Wave and COND of their ordered factors), but it is easy to view in Excel.
```{r}
#write the simulated data  as a .csv
#write.table(Murrar_df, file="DiffCSV.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file
#Murrar_df <- read.csv ("DiffCSV.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Scenario #1:  Controlling for the pretest

So that we can begin to understand how the covariate operates, we are going to predict attitudes towards Arabs at post-test (AttArabP1) by condition (COND), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline (AttArabB). You may notice that in this analysis we are ignoring the second post-test. This is because I am simply demonstrating ANCOVA. To ignore the second post test would be a significant loss of information.

### Preparing the data

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a pretest, we need three variables:

* IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Little Mosque conditions
* DV that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at post1
* Covariate that is continuous; in our case it is the attitudes toward Arabs at baseline

The form of our data matters.  The simulation created a *long* form (formally called the *person-period* form) of data.  That is, each observation for each person is listed in its own row. In this dataset where we have 193 people with 3 observation (baseline, post1, post2) each, we have 579 rows. In ANCOVA where we use the pre-test as a covariate, we need all the data to be on a single row.This is termed the *person level* form of data. We can restructure the data with the *data.table* and *reshape2*()* packages.  

```{r }
library(reshape2)
# Create a new df (Murrar_wide)
# Identify the original df
#In the transition from long-to-wide it seems like you can only do one time-varying variable at a time
#When there are multiple time-varying and time-static variables, but all the time-static variables on the left side of the tilde
#Put the name of the single time-varying variable in the concatonated list
Murrar1 <- reshape2::dcast(data = Murrar_df, formula =caseID +COND ~ Wave, value.var = "AttArab")
#before restructuring a second variable, rename the first variable
Murrar1 <- rename(Murrar1, AttArabB = "Baseline", AttArabP1 = "Post1", AttArabP2 = "Post2")
#repeat the process for additional variables; but give the new df new names -- otherwise you'll overwrite your work
Murrar2 <- reshape2::dcast(data = Murrar_df, formula =caseID ~Wave, value.var = "AttWhite")
Murrar2 <- rename(Murrar2, AttWhiteB = "Baseline", AttWhiteP1 = "Post1", AttWhiteP2 = "Post2")
#Now we join them
Murrar_wide <- dplyr::full_join(Murrar1, Murrar2, by = c("caseID"))

str(Murrar_wide )
```
If you want to export this data as a file to your computer, remove the hashtags to save it (and re-import it) as a .csv ("Excel lite") or .rds (R object) file. This is not a necessary step.

The code for the .rds file will retain the formatting of the variables, but is not easy to view outside of R. This is what I would do.
```{r}
#to save the df as an .rds (think "R object") file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with
#saveRDS(Murrar_wide, "MurrarW_RDS.rds")
#bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file
#Murrar_wide <- readRDS("MurrarW_RDS.rds")
```

The code for .csv will likely lose the formatting (i.e., stripping Wave and COND of their ordered factors), but it is easy to view in Excel.
```{r}
#write the simulated data  as a .csv
#write.table(Murrar_wide, file="MurrarW_CSV.csv", sep=",", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE)
#bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file
#Murrar_wide <- read.csv ("MurrarW_CSV.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### Checking the assumptions

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA.  These include:

* random sampling and independence in the scores representing the dependent variable
* linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
* homogeneity of the regression slopes
* a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
* homogeneity of variance

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

![Image of the ANCOVA decision tree, showing our current place in the workflow.](images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_assumptions.jpg)

#### Linearity assumption

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable.  In our case this means that there is linearity between the pre-test (covariate) and post-test (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between covariate (our pretest) and the outcome (follow-up test).

```{r }
library(ggpubr)
ggscatter (
  Murrar_wide, x = "AttArabB", y = "AttArabP1",
  color = "COND", add = "reg.line"
)+
  stat_regline_equation(
    aes(label =  paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = "~~~~"), color = COND)
    )

```

Yikes!  This plot looks like an interaction!

#### Homogeneity of regression slopes

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group.  The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate.  The plotted regression lines should be parallel.


```{r }
library(rstatix)
Murrar_wide %>% anova_test(AttArabP1 ~ COND*AttArabB)

```
Preliminary analysis did not support ANCOVA as a statistical option in that there was a violation of the homogeneity of regression slopes as the interaction term was statistically significant, *F* (1, 189) = 4.297, *p* = .040, $\eta^2$ = 0.022.  We should probably stop here. However, for the sake of demonstration, I will continue. One of the reasons I wanted to work this example as ANCOVA is to demonstrate that covariates and moderators each have their role. We can already see how this data is best analyzed with mixed design ANOVA.

#### Normality of residuals

Our goal here is to specify a model and extract *residuals*:  the difference between the observed value of the DV and its predicted value.  Each data point has one residual. The sum and mean of residuals are equal to 0.

Once we have the residuals, we can treat them as data and evaluate if they are normally distributed. We first compute the model with *lm()* (lm stands for "linear model").  This is a linear regression.

```{r }
AttArabB_Mod <- lm (AttArabP1 ~ AttArabB + COND, data = Murrar_wide) #Create a linear regression model predicting DV from COV & IV
AttArabB_Mod
```
From the *broom* package (with the *augment(model)* function) we can augment our *lm()* model object  to add fitted values and residuals. 
```{r }
library(broom)
AttArabB_Mod.metrics <- augment(AttArabB_Mod) #new model by augmenting the lm model
head(AttArabB_Mod.metrics,3) #shows the first three rows of the UEmodel.metrics
```

From this, we can assess the normality of the residuals using the Shapiro Wilk test

```{r }
shapiro_test(AttArabB_Mod.metrics$.resid)#apply shapiro_test to that augmented model
```
Yikes again!  The statistically significant Shapiro Wilk test indicated a violation of the normality assumption (*W* = 0.984, *p* = .026).


#### Homogeneity of variances

ANCOVA presumes that the variance of the residuals is equal for all groups.  We can check this with the Levene's test.
```{r }
AttArabB_Mod.metrics %>% levene_test(.resid ~ COND) 
```
A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups (*F*[1, 191] = 3.515 *p* = .062).

#### Outliers

We can identify outliers by examining the standardized (or studentized) residual.  This is the residual divided by its estimated standard error. Standardized residuals are interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line.
```{r check for outliers}
AttArabB_Mod.metrics%>% #from our model metrics
  filter(abs(.std.resid)>3)%>% #show us any standardized residuals that are >3
  as.data.frame()
```
We do have one outlier with a standardized residual that has an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this.  If this were "for real" I might more closely inspect these data.  I would look at the whole response.  If any response seems invalid (e.g., random responding) I would delete it.  If the responses seem valid, I *could* truncate them to exactly 3 SEs or (more likely) ignore it.  Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] has a great section on some of these options.

As noted by the suggestion of an interaction effect, our preliminary analyses suggests that ANCOVA is not the best option. We know from the prior lesson that a mixed design ANOVA worked well. In the spirit of an example, here's a preliminary write-up so far:

#### Write-up of Assumptions

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, condition, had two levels:  Friends, Little Mosque. The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs expressed by the participant at post-test and covariate was the pre-test assessment of the same variable.  A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable,  *F* (1, 189) = 4.297, *p* = .040, $\eta^2$ = 0.022. Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,*W* = 0.984, *p* = .026.  Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, *F*(1, 191) = 3.515 *p* = .062.

### Calculating the Omnibus ANOVA

We are ready to conduct the omnibus ANOVA.

![Image of the ANCOVA decision tree, showing our current place in the workflow.](images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_omnibus.jpg)

*Order of variable entry* matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the *controlling for* language associate with covariates, we want to remove the effect of the covariate before we run the one-way ANOVA. With this ANCOVA we are asking the question, "Does the condition (Friends or Little Mosque) contribute to more positive attitudes toward Arabs, when controlling for the pre-test score.

In repeated measures projects, we expect there to be dependency in the data. That is, in most cases prior waves will have significant prediction on later waves. When ANCOVA uses a prior asssessment or wave as a covariate, that variable "claims" as much variance as possible and the subsequent variable can capture what is left over.

In the code below, we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from the condition (Friends or Little Mosque), controlling for attitudes toward Arabs at baseline.

The *ges* column provides the effect size, $\eta^2$ where a general rule-of-thumb for interpretation is .02 (small), .13 (medium), and .26 (large) [@lakens_calculating_2013].
```{r }
MurrarB_ANCOVA <- Murrar_wide %>%
  anova_test(AttArabP1 ~ AttArabB + COND)
get_anova_table(MurrarB_ANCOVA )
```
There was a non-significant effect of the baseline covariate on the post-test (*F*[1, 190] = 0.665, *p* = .416, $\eta^2$ = 0.003). After controlling for the baseline attitudes toward Arabs, there was a statistically significant effect of condition on post-test attitudes toward Arabs, *F*(1,190) = 26.361, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = 0.122. This appears to be a moderately sized effect. 

### Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (controlling for the covariate)

Just like in one-way ANOVA, we follow-up the significant effect of condition.  We'll use all-possible pairwise comparisons. In our case, we only have two levels of the categorical factor, so this run wouldn't be necessary. I included it to provide the code for doing so.  If there were three or more variables, we would see all possible comparisons.

```{r }
library(emmeans)
pwc_B <- Murrar_wide %>%
  emmeans_test(
    AttArabP1 ~ COND, covariate = AttArabB,
    p.adjust.method = "none"
  )
pwc_B
```

Not surprisingly (since this single pairwise comparison is redundant with the omnibus ANCOVA), results suggest a statistically significant difference between Friends and Little Mosque at Post1.

With the script below we can obtain the covariate-adjusted marginal means.  These are termed **estimated marginal means.**  Take a look at these and compare them to what we would see in the regular descriptives. It is helpful to see the grand mean (AttArabB) and then the marginal means (emmean).

```{r }
emmeans_B <- get_emmeans(pwc_B)
emmeans_B
```

Note that the *emmeans* process produces slightly different means than the raw means from the *psych* package's *describeBy()* function. Why?  Because the *get_emmeans()* function uses the model that included the covariate.  The *estimated* means are covariate-adjusted.  
```{r }
library(psych)
descripts_P1 <- describeBy(AttArabP1 ~ COND, data = Murrar_wide, mat = TRUE)
descripts_P1
```

(*M* = 59.02, *SD* = 21.65)
(*M* = 73.92, *SD* = 18.51) 

In our case the adjustments are very minor.  Why?  The effect of the attitudes toward Arabs baseline test on the attitudes toward Arabs post test was nonsignificant.  In fact, our correlation is...

```{r }
#getting p values requires the corr.test function from the psych package; 
#because some function names appear is multiple packages, it is sometimes essential to point a function to the proper package
#use the double colon to specify package and function
MurP1_Rmat <- psych::corr.test(Murrar_wide[c("AttArabB", "AttArabP1")]) 
MurP1_Rmat
```
...almost negligible (*r* = -0.05, *p* = .47)

### Toward an APA style results section

Tables with the means, adjusted means, and correlations may be helpful. 

```{r}
apaTables::apa.cor.table(Murrar_wide[c("AttArabB", "AttArabP1")], table.number = 1 )
#You can save this as a Microsoft word document by adding this statement into the command: filename = "your_filename.doc" 
```

Additionally, writing this output to excel files helped create the two tables that follow. The *MASS* package is useful to export the model objects into .csv files. They are easily opened in Excel where they can be manipulated into tables for presentations and manuscripts.

```{r }

Unlike the figure we created when we were testing assumptions, this script creates a plot from the model (which identifies AttArabB in its role as covariate). Thus, the relationship between condition and AttArabP1 controls for the effect of the AttArabB covariate.

**Results**

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, condition, had two levels:  Friends, Little Mosque.  The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs expressed by the participant at post-test and covariate was the baseline assessment of the same variable. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. A preliminary analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable differed significantly as a function of the independent variable,  *F* (1, 189) = 4.297, *p* = .040, $\eta^2$ = 0.022. Regarding the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor, results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was also significant,*W* = 0.984, *p* = .026.  Only one datapoint (in the Little Mosque condition) had a standardized residual (-3.37) that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. A non-significant Levene's test indicated no violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, *F*(1, 191) = 3.515 *p* = .062.

There was a non-significant effect of the baseline covariate on the post-test (*F*[1, 190] = 0.665, *p* = .416, $\eta^2$ = 0.003). After controlling for the baseline attitudes toward Arabs, there was a statistically significant effect of condition on post-test attitudes toward Arabs, *F*(1,190) = 26.361, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = 0.122. This appears to be moderate in size. Given there were only two conditions, no further follow-up was required. As illustrated in Figure 1, results suggest that those in the Little Mosque condition (*M* = 73.92, *SD* = 18.51) had more favorable attitudes toward Arabs than those in the Friends condition (*M* = 59.02, *SD* = 21.65). Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.


## Scenario #2:  Controlling for a confounding or covarying variable

In the scenario below, I am simulating a one-way ANCOVA, predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 as a function of sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque), controlling for the participants' attitudes toward Whites. That is, the ANCOVA will compare the the means of the two groups (at post1, only), adjusted for level of attitudes toward Whites

TO BE CLEAR:  This is not the best way to analyze this data.  With such a strong, balanced design, the multi-way, mixed design ANOVAs were an excellent choice that provided much fuller information than this demonstration, below.  The purpose of this over-simplified demonstration is merely to give another example of using a variable as a *covariate* rather than a *moderator.*

### Preparing the data

When the covariate in ANCOVA is a potentially confounding variable, we need three variables:

* IV that has two or more levels; in our case it is the Friends and Littls Mosque sitcom conditions.
* DV that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Arabs at post1 (AttArabP1).
* Covariate that is continuous; in our case it attitudes toward Whites at post1 (AttWhiteP1).  *Note* We could have also chosen attitudes toward Whites at baseline.

We can continue using the Murrar_wide df.

### Checking the assumptions

There are a number of assumptions in ANCOVA.  These include:

* random sampling and independence in the scores representing the dependent variable
* linearity of the relationship between the covariate and DV within all levels of the independent variable
* homogeneity of the regression slopes
* a normally distributed DV for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor
* homogeneity of variance

These are depicted in the flowchart, below.

![Image of the ANCOVA decision tree, showing our current place in the workflow.](images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_assumptions.jpg)

#### Linearity assumption

ANCOVA assumes that there is linearity between the covariate and outcome variable at each level of the grouping variable.  In our case this means that there is linearity between the attitudes toward Whites (covariate) and attitudes toward Arabs (outcome variable) at each level of the intervention (Friends, Little Mosque).

We can create a scatterplot (with regression lines) between the covariate (attitudes toward Whites) and the outcome (attitudes toward Arabs).

```{r }
library(ggpubr)
ggscatter (
  Murrar_wide, x = "AttWhiteP1", y = "AttArabP1",
  color = "COND", add = "reg.line"
)+
  stat_regline_equation(
    aes(label =  paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = "~~~~"), color = COND)
    )

```
As we look at this scatterplot, we are trying to determine if there is an interaction effect (rather than a covarying effect).  The linearity here, looks reasonable and not terribly "interacting" (to help us decide whether empathy should be a covariate or a moderator). More testing can help us make this distinction.

#### Homogeneity of regression slopes

This assumption requires that the slopes of the regression lines formed by the covariate and the outcome variable are the same for each group.  The assumption evaluates that there is no interaction between the outcome and covariate.  The plotted regression lines should be parallel.

```{r }
Murrar_wide %>% anova_test(AttArabP1 ~ COND*AttWhiteP1)
```
Preliminary analysis supported ANCOVA as a statistical option in that there was no violation of the homogeneity of regression slopes as the interaction term was not statistically significant, *F* (1, 189) = 1.886, *p* = .171, $\eta^2$ = 0.010.

#### Normality of residuals

Assessing the normality of residuals means running the model, capturing the unexplained portion of the model (i.e., the *residuals*), and then seeing if they are normally distributed. Proper use of ANCOVA is predicated on normally distributed residuals.

We first compute the model with *lm()*. The *lm()* function is actually testing what we want to test. However, at this early stage, we are just doing a "quick run and interpretation" to see if we are within the assumptions of ANCOVA.
```{r }
WhCov_mod <- lm (AttArabP1 ~ AttWhiteP1 + COND, data = Murrar_wide) #Create a linear regression model predicting DV from COV & IV
WhCov_mod
```
We can use the *augment(model)* function rom the *broom* package to add fitted values and residuals. 
```{r }
library(broom)
WhCov_mod.metrics <- augment(WhCov_mod)
head(WhCov_mod.metrics,3) #shows the first three rows of the UEcon_model.metrics
```
Now we assess the normality of residuals using the Shapiro Wilk test.  The script below captures the ".resid" column from the model.

```{r }
shapiro_test(WhCov_mod.metrics$.resid)
```
Yikes!  The statistically significant Shapiro Wilk test indicate a violation of the normality assumption (*W* = 0.984, *p* = .029). As I mentioned before, there are better ways to analyze this research vignette. I am only modeling this as an alternative.

#### Homogeneity of variances

ANCOVA presumes that the variance of the residuals is equal for all groups.  We can check this with the Levene's test.

```{r }
WhCov_mod.metrics %>% levene_test(.resid ~ COND)
```
Yikes again. A statistically significant Levene's test indicates a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances (*F*[1, 191] = 4.539, *p* = .034).

#### Outliers

We can identify outliers by examining the standardized (or studentized) residual.  This is the residual divided by its estimated standard error. Standardized residuals are interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line.

```{r }
WhCov_mod.metrics %>%
  filter(abs(.std.resid)>3)%>%
  as.data.frame()
```
There is one outlier with a standardized residual with an absolute value greater than 3. At this point I am making a mental note of this.  If this were "for real" I might more closely inspect these data.  I would look at the whole response.  If any response seems invalid (e.g., random responding) I would delete it.  If the responses seem valid, I *could* truncate them to exactly 3 SEs or (more likely) ignore it.  Kline [-@kline_principles_2016] has a great section on some of these options.

#### Write-up of Assumptions

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels:  Friends, Little Mosque.  The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. Preliminary anlayses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable (*F* [1, 189] = 1.886, *p* = .171, $\eta^2$ = 0.010) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption. In contrast, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on the model residuals was statistically significant (*W* = 0.984, *p* = .029). This means that we likely violated the assumption that the dependent variable is normally distributed in the population for any specific value of the covariate and for any one level of a factor. Regarding outliers, one datapoint (-3.38) had a standardized residual that exceeded an absolute value of 3.0. Further, a statistically significant Levene's test indicated a violation of the homogeneity of the residual variances for all groups, (*F*[1, 191] = 4.539, *p* = .034). *Because the intent of this analysis was to demonstrate how ANCOVA differs from mixed design ANOVA we proceeded with the analysis. Were this for "real research" we would have chosen a different analysis.*

### Calculating the Omnibus ANOVA

We are ready to conduct the omnibus ANOVA.

![Image of the ANCOVA decision tree, showing our current place in the workflow.](images/ANCOVA/wf_ANCOVA_omnibus.jpg)

*Order of variable entry* matters in ANCOVA. Thinking of the *controlling for* language associated with covariates, we firstly want to remove the effect of the covariate.

In the code below we are predicting attitudes toward Arabs at post1 from attitudes toward Whites at post1 (the covariate) and sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque).

The *ges* column provides the effect size, $\eta^2$ where a general rule-of-thumb for interpretation is .01 (small), .06 (medium), and .14 (large) [@lakens_calculating_2013].

```{r }
WhCov_ANCOVA <- Murrar_wide %>%
  anova_test(AttArabP1 ~ AttWhiteP1 + COND)
get_anova_table(WhCov_ANCOVA)
```

There was a non-significant effect of the attitudes toward Whites covariate on the attitudes toward Arabs at post-test, *F* (1,190) = 0.014, *p* = .907, $\eta^2$ < .001. After controlling for attitudes toward Whites, there was a statistically significant effect in attitudes toward Arabs at post-test between the conditions, *F*(1. 190) = 26.119, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = 0.121. The effect size was moderate.

### Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (controlling for the covariate)

With only two levels of sitcom condition (Friends, Little Mosque), we do not need to conduct post-hoc pairwise comparisons.  However, because many research designs involve three or more levels, I will demonstrate them here.
```{r }
library(emmeans)
pwc_cond <- Murrar_wide %>%
  emmeans_test(
    AttArabP1 ~ COND, covariate = AttWhiteP1,
    p.adjust.method = "none"
  )
pwc_cond
```

Results suggest a statistically significant post-test difference between the Friends and Little Mosque sitcom conditions. 

With the script below we can obtain the covariate-adjusted marginal means.  These are termed *estimated marginal means.*

```{r }
emmeans_cond <- get_emmeans(pwc_cond)
emmeans_cond
```

As before, these means are usually different (even if only ever-so-slightly) than the raw means you would obtain from the descriptives.

```{r}
descripts_cond <- psych::describeBy(AttArabP1 ~ COND, data = Murrar_wide, mat = TRUE)
descripts_cond
```


### Toward an APA style results section

Tables with the means, adjusted means, and pairwise comparison output may be helpful. The *apa.cor.table()* function in the *apaTables* package is helpful for providing means, standarddeviations, and correlations.

```{r}
apaTables::apa.cor.table(Murrar_wide[c("AttArabP1", "AttWhiteP1")], table.number = 2 )
#You can save this as a Microsoft word document by adding this statement into the command: filename = "your_filename.doc" 
```

Writing this output to excel files helped create the two tables that follow.

```{r }
library(MASS)
write.matrix(pwc_cond, sep = ",", file = "pwc_con.csv")
write.matrix(emmeans_cond, sep = ",", file = "emmeans_con.csv")
write.matrix(descripts_cond, sep = ",", file = "descripts_con.csv")
```

Ultimately, I would want a table that included this information. Please refer to the APA style manual for more proper formatting for a manuscript that requires APA style.

Unlike the figure we created when we were testing assumptions, this script creates a plot from the model (which identifies AttWhiteP1 in its role as covariate). Thus, the relationship between condition and AttArabP1 controls for the effect of the AttArabB covariate.

```{r }
pwc_cond <- pwc_cond %>% add_xy_position(x = "COND", fun = "mean_se")
ggline(get_emmeans(pwc_B), x = "COND", y = "emmean") +

  stat_pvalue_manual(pwc_B, hide.ns = TRUE, tip.length = FALSE) +
  labs(
    subtitle = get_test_label(WhCov_ANCOVA, detailed = TRUE),
    caption = get_pwc_label(pwc_cond)
  )
```
**Results**

A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. The independent variable, sitcom condition, had two levels:  Friends, Little Mosque.  The dependent variable was attitudes towards Arabs at pre-test. Preliminary analyses which tested the assumptions of ANCOVA were mixed. Results suggesting that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable (*F* [1, 189] = 1.886, *p* = .171, $\eta^2$ = 0.010) provided evidence that we did not violate the homogeneity-of-slopes assumption.

Were this for "real research" we would have chosen a different analysis.*

There was a non-significant effect of the attitudes toward Whites covariate on the attitudes toward Arabs post-test, *F* (1,190) = 0.014, *p* = .907, $\eta^2$ < .001. After controlling for attitudes toward Whites, there was a statistically significant effect in attitudes toward Arabs at post-test between the conditions, *F*(1. 190) = 26.119, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = 0.121. The effect size was moderately large. Means and covariate-adjusted means are presented in Table 1b.


## More (and a recap) on covariates

Covariates, sometimes termed *controls* are often used to gain statistical control over variables that are difficult to control in a research design. That is, it may be impractical for polychotomize an otherwise continuous variable and/or it is impractical to have multiple factors and so a covariate is a more manageable approach. Common reasons for including covariates include [@bernerth_critical_2016]:

* they mathematically remove variance associated with nonfocal variables,
* the *purification principle* -- removing unwanted or confusing variance,
* they remove the *noise* in the analysis to clear up the clear up the relationship between IV and DVs.

Perhaps it is an oversimplification, but we can think of three categories of variables:  moderators, covariates, and mediators.  Through ANOVA and ANCOVA, we distinguish between moderator and covariate.

**Moderator**: a variable that changes the strength or direction of an effect between two variables X (predictor, independent variable) and Y (criterion, dependent variable).

**Covariate**:  an observed, continuous variable, that (when used properly) has a relationship with the dependent variable.  It is included in the analysis, as a predictor, so that the predictive relationship between the independent (IV) and dependent (DV) are adjusted.

Bernerth and Aguinis [-@bernerth_critical_2016] conducted a review of how and when control variables were used in nearly 600 articles published between 2003 and 2012.  Concurrently with their analysis, they provided guidance for when to use control variables (covariates).  The flowchart that accompanies their article is quite helpful. Control variables (covariates) should only be used when:

1. Theory suggests that the potential covariate(s) relate(s) to variable(s) in the currrent study.
2. There is empirical justification for including the covariate in the study.
3. The covariate can be measured reliably.

## Practice Problems
   
In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. With each of these options I encourage you to:

* test the statistical assumptions
* conduct an ANCOVA where the covariate is
* if the predictor variable has more three or more levels, conduct follow-up testing 
* present both means and coviarate-adjusted means
* write a results section to include a figure and tables


### Problem #1:  Play around with this simulation.

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.  

* If ANCOVA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in "set.seed(210813)" from 210813 to something else. Then rework Scenario#1, Scenario#2, or both. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.
* If you are interested in power, change the sample size to something larger or smaller.
* If you are interested in variability (i.e., the homogeneity of variance assumption), perhaps you change the standard deviations in a way that violates the assumption.

Using the lecture and workflow (chart) as a guide, please work through all the steps listed in the proposed assignment/grading rubric.
